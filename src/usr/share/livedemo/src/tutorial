      Example: 
        hdd: "
rlred "/dev/hda"
rdef " | size: 6MB | partition: "
rlpin "/dev/hda1\n"
rdef "        filesystem: ext4 | new partition size: "
rlyel "2M"
rdef "B

     1. Put some data on the mounted "
rlpin "/dev/hda1"
rdef " partition
        and unmout it.
     2. Run fsck on the filesystem: "
rlwhi "e2fsck -f "
rlpin "/dev/hda1"
rdef "
     3. Resize the filesystem: "
rlwhi "resize2fs "
rlpin "/dev/hda1 "
rlyel "2M"
rdef "
     4. Delete the partition: "
rlwhi "fdisk "
rlred "/dev/hda\n"
rlwhi "          [d]"
rdef " delete partition | partition number if needed\n"
rlwhi "          [w]"
rdef " write table to disk and exit.
     5. Create a new, smaller partition: "
rlwhi "fdisk "
rlred "/dev/hda\n"
rlwhi "          [n] "
rdef "add a new "
rlwhi "[p] "
rdef "primary partition
          select partition number
          First sector: "
rlwhi "[Enter/default]"
rdef " | Last sector: "
rlwhi "+"
rlyel "2M"
rdef "
          Do you want to remove the signature?: "
rlwhi "[N]"
rdef " - no\n"
rlwhi "          [w]"
rdef " write table to disk and exit.
     6. Mount this new "
rlpin "/dev/hda1"
rdef " partition and check Your\n        data on it.\n"
rdef "     7. Using "
rlwhi "fdisk/cfdisk "
rdef "and "
rlwhi "mkfs.ext4"
rdef ", you can create\n        the second partition "
rlpin "/dev/hda2"
rdef " in the free space.
