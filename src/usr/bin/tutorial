      Example: 
        hdd: "
rlred "/dev/vda"
rdef " | size: 60GB | partition: "
rlpin "/dev/vda2\n"
rdef "        filesystem: ext4 | new partition size: "
rlyel "12G"
rdef    "B\n\n     1. Run fsck on the filesystem: "
rlwhi "e2fsck -f "
rlpin "/dev/vda2"
rdef "
     2. Resize the filesystem: "
rlwhi "resize2fs "
rlpin "/dev/vda2 "
rlyel "12G"
rdef "
     3. Delete the partition: "
rlwhi "fdisk "
rlred "/dev/vda\n"
rlwhi "          [d]"
rdef " delete partition | partition number if needed\n"
rlwhi "          [w]"
rdef " write table to disk and exit.
     4. Create a new, smaller partition: "
rlwhi "fdisk "
rlred "/dev/vda\n"
rlwhi "          [n] "
rdef "add a new "
rlwhi "[p] "
rdef "primary partition
          select partition number
          First sector: "
rlwhi "[Enter/default]"
rdef " | Last sector: "
rlwhi "+"
rlyel "12G"
rdef "
          Do you want to remove the signature?: "
rlwhi "[N]"
rdef " - no\n"
rlwhi "          [w]"
rdef " write table to disk and exit.
     5. Mount this new "
rlpin "/dev/vda2"
rdef " partition and check Your\n        data on it.\n"
rdef "     6. Using "
rlwhi "fdisk/cfdisk "
rdef "and "
rlwhi "mkfs.ext4"
rdef ", you can create\n        the second partition "
rlpin "/dev/vda3"
rdef " in the free space.
